<br><br>
01. They did such a great job and were quick and efficient. Also, our backyard is cleaner now than it was before they
came! We would definitely recommend to anyone looking to have their roof replaced.<br><br>
02. We used (AZ INNOVATION) to replacement our roof as well as to extend the roof-line over an expanded patio addition.
The (AZ INNOVATION) team did a great job. They showed up on time, worked hard, cleaned up, and completed the projects
quickly and as scheduled.<br><br>
03. (AZ INNOVATION) has done a wonderful job each time they have done work on our home. Their employees are always on
time, professional and work hard to get the job done in a timely manner. I highly recommend (AZ INNOVATION) for roofing
or general repair / construction needs.<br><br>

04. I have used (AZ INNOVATION) for two different house roof replacements. They did an excellent job and the work was
done in a timely and professional manner. In both cases, (AZ INNOVATION) worked with our insurance company to make sure
we received the coverage that was provided.<br><br>

05. Thank goodness for (AZ INNOVATION), My home looks fabulous. You can’t even tell it was a construction sight & they
dug 8 feet down to repair the pipes. I Highly recommend!!<br><br>

06. Top notch Professionals! (AZ INNOVATION) keep everything on track and was great to work with. This is the roofer
everyone needs when working with an insurance company. (AZ INNOVATION) knew exactly what documents they needed to move
the claim forward. We got a great quality roof quickly and they were easy to work with. Thanks<br><br>
07. (AZ INNOVATION) is a great company to do business with! They are prompt and timely with their service when it comes
to scheduling. As far as workmanship they just cannot be beat and I would recommend them over any other roofing company
in the Metro area. When that next Storm comes through and you have questions about the status of your roof call these
guys first!<br><br>

08. I highly recommend (AZ INNOVATION). The estimate was done by the owner and he stayed right on target. They crew is
very skilled. They were efficient, responsive and easy to communicate with. Our siding and awnings look amazing! It
feels like we are in a brand new house.<br><br>

09. (AZ INNOVATION) and his guys were so professional and courteous. They completed our siding in a timely manner and
they did quality work. Our home looks beautiful!! (CN) was always available to answer questions and address concerns
from start to finish. I would highly recommend this company.<br><br>

10. (AZ INNOVATION) and his crew were so wonderful and the quality of their product was fantastic. We had tails put on
our porch and he did great matching the style of the house. The rails are sturdy and just look great. We couldn’t be
more pleased with his service!
